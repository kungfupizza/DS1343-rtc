# DS1343-rtc

The DS1343/DS1344 low-current real-time clocks (RTCs)
are timekeeping devices that provide an extremely low
standby current, permitting longer life from a backup
supply source. The devices also support high-ESR
crystals, broadening the pool of usable crystals for the
devices. The clock/calendar provides seconds, minutes,
hours, day, date, month, and year information. The date
at the end of the month is automatically adjusted for
months with fewer than 31 days, including corrections
for leap year. The clock operates in either 24-hour or
12-hour format with an AM/PM indicator

The library is made for ATMEGA2560
